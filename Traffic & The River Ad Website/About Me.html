      <p class="ContentText">Hello there, I&rsquo;m Gregory Desrosiers. I&rsquo;m 18 years old and a  student of Champlain College St-Lambert. I&rsquo;m studying Computer Science in  becoming a computer game and site designer. </p>
      <p class="ContentText">Ever since my childhood, I&rsquo;ve been occupied mostly with  electronics that you would normally see what&rsquo;s happening with the system on the  TV or the monitor. However, after spending a few years working with a few  social workers in an attempt for me to be adapted to more freedom, I decided to  become more sociable. One of the key breakthroughs was when in Summer 2009, I  started having my own Facebook account. Today, I still use it a lot, because it  would be the cure for social dependency, where if I wasn&rsquo;t on Facebook, I would  feel like I&rsquo;m not integrated to society enough.</p>
      <p class="ContentText">The thing about becoming a game designer is, if you&rsquo;re  trying to get used to an artificial world and there&rsquo;s a story on top of it, you  should go through it to explore the world itself. Of course, a world isn&rsquo;t  complete with scenery, terrain, characters, and of course, what happens. What  matters is you put every single detail in the right way, and make sure it  flows. If you have a glitch in the game, it distorts the world and the feeling  becomes destroyed. Becoming a Web designer also sometimes has a fundamental  artificial world where the site is like a castle and the pages you enter are  the rooms. The Contact Us page would become the throne room, where the king or  queen has the power. That would be the person who&rsquo;s in charge of the whole  castle, which would be like me, as Web Producer &amp; Director.</p>
      <p class="ContentText">I was diagnosed with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome when I was two and  I began going through a lot of stressful stuff that I wanted to keep to myself,  be so self-centered and not adapt to the real world. But sometime during high  school, I began adapting up to the level where I&rsquo;m much closer to being like  everyone else at the level of society.</p>
      <p class="ContentText">The reason why I&rsquo;m making Traffic &amp; The River is the  fact that in Summer 2011, I was not able to get a job. Not because the market  was closed, but because I had a preferred salary on my CV. I wanted to make $15  / hr because I wanted to save money in my debit account for setting up a  company to develop video games and develop &amp; publish online games on what  may become our Web site. It&rsquo;s the economic inflation that makes me want to  invest a lot instead of sticking with the usual $10/hr or minimal wage. By the  time I graduate from university, even if I make a business plan, I may need a  capital investment of a lot more than $2 million to hire the required software  engineers, Web engineers, artists and all other important positions. I&rsquo;ll have  to hire more than 200 employees to meet the demands of today&rsquo;s Internet and  video game markets.</p>
      <p class="ContentText">Another reason why I&rsquo;m doing it is because besides helping  me get out of a situation where I&rsquo;m feeling too disadvantaged, I also want to  spend a couple of weeks in New York City either as a vacation or both vacation  and marketing my music videos. </p>
      <p class="ContentText">Although I do want to get together with my friends, the  trouble is, whenever they want to spend time together, they don&rsquo;t want to  invite me. However, as I was doing my first semester of college, my English  teacher, Ms. Norcene Webb, noticed that I&rsquo;m having trouble with language  skills, and actually, it&rsquo;s true. There are so many vocabulary words, clich&eacute;s,  and expressions that I am not aware of where if I had more of a linguistic  sense, then I can explain my stuff more coherently as well as develop more of my  interest to friends by exploring more of what they like. I even tried out a  book that Barbara Goodall (one of the technicians at Heritage Regional High  School&rsquo;s Student Services) gave me in which it contained idioms, but it was  nearly impossible for me to keep the meaning and the words together in my head.  I&rsquo;m more of a person who is productive at something instead of going farther in  terms of language skills. Still, I&rsquo;m doing my best to get help on language  skills.</p>
      <p class="ContentText">New York City has its own world to share with the people on  planet Earth. It&rsquo;s even going to share with me! I rather be in cities that have  things like LED and LCD billboards on buildings and feel like you&rsquo;re in the  middle of a city with so much to do. I really want to spend my time checking  out the major highlights, including the Empire State Building, Times Square,  Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, and the World Trade Center  Memorial. I want to listen to &ldquo;Empire State of Mind&rdquo; by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys  as I explore and even spend some time on the beaches checking out the  amusements, the fresh Atlantic Ocean, and of course, the arcade parlors. All I  need to do is enjoy the ride, on the NYC Subway, to Long Island. Besides, I  can&rsquo;t wait to enjoy the fabulous breakfasts I would deserve to pay and eat over  there in the city of my dreams. Best of all, I want to be engaged socially,  which means I want to encourage my friends who knew me for long to come to New  York and spend the vacation with me. They can even be engaged with me to sell the  pack to New Yorkers who want to explore more about me and want to see it.  There&rsquo;s so many to do in New York, it&rsquo;s like you want to live over there to  feel like you are really part of the world, in a more recognizable fashion.</p>
      <p class="ContentText">So, let&rsquo;s see if my dream will really come true! If you&rsquo;re  looking for a recognizable man who will want to create a video game with  Nintendo&rsquo;s Princess Daisy, please consider me!</p>
